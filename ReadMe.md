# Test project based on an Auth0 Blog Post

[Original Post](https://auth0.com/blog/use-typescript-to-create-a-secure-api-with-nodejs-and-express-getting-started/)

To use: 
* Open a terminal, nav to the root and run `npm run webpack`
    * this will cause a process to monitor the source for changes and repack to `dist/index.js` when they are detected
* Open a terminal, nav to the root and run `npm start` to run what is in `dist/index.js`
    * alternately from vscode just hit `F5` to do the same thing
